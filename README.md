Project For Computer Networks Subject

Instructions and Requirements:

--gcc : V.8.1 or later

For Windows:

1.-Compile both coder.cpp and decoder.cpp with funciones.cpp and move both .exes to the root directory. 

You can use the Makefile to compile (just change the file name).

2.- Use "npm install" to install all JS dependencies (Express,multer, etc).

3.- Use node server.js to launch. By default, server will run on localhost:3000

For Linux:

1.-Compile both coder.cpp and decoder.cpp with funciones.cpp as "coder and decoder" (DO NOT USE .EXE EXTENSION)

and give them chmod +x access. Move them to root directory. Other solution to "Permission denied" problem would be to use chmod -R 777 on root directory.

2- Use npm install as for Windows.

3.- Use node server to launch.


Enjoy!
